# Heroku

## Summary

With a few web applications under our belts, it's time to take it up a notch. We've worked with Tomcat and MySQL, both of which we hosted locally on our own machines. Now, we're going to dive into the world of Platform-as-a-Service \(Paas\), which will allow us to host our applications for all the world to see.

To get our feet wet, we're going to walk through creating and deploying a simple Java web application on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Let's hear in their own words what Heroku is.

> Heroku is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor, and scale apps â€” we're the fastest way to go from idea to URL, bypassing all those infrastructure headaches.

That's right off their website. But, what does that mean for us? Well, it means we can deploy our applications to a Heroku server and make them accessible to anyone from anywhere.

## Creating an Account

To get started, we'll need a Heroku account. All you need is an email. If you do choose to use a district-issued email account, it'll likely get bogged down in the spam filters
